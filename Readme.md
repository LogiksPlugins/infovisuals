Logiks Infovisual Plugin
=======================

# Overview

Information visualization is the process of representing data in a visual and meaningful ways using CARDS of information so that a user can better understand it. Infovisual Plugin is for managing and administrating infovisual reports within Logiks. In addition, the Infovisual Module provides a flexible and extensible API that module developers can use to build their own advanced infovisual reports and tools.
